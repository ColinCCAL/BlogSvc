Welcome to my blog. My name is Colin and I have recently began a new career as a software engineer. This blog will explore my adventures as an
engineer and my other interests. Currently, the technologies I am working with are Java, .net, AngularJS/Web, database work, etc.

I am 27 years old, recently married, and owner of an awesome cocker spaniel border collie mix name Enzo. Growing up I was a competitive gymnast for which
I received an athletic scholarship to UC Berkeley. There I studied Applied Mathematics and Statistics. After graduating I coached the NCAA gymnastics team
which I had been a member of. I had always dabbled with programming and decided I wanted to make a career move. I have now been working as an engineer for
about 7 months, which brings me to today.
